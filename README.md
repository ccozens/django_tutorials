# django_tutorials

I decided the time has come to learn django! So I'm starting with a bunch of tutorials.

## 1. [MDN Local Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)
An intro to Django that assumes knowledge of serve-side programming, web frameworks and Python. I've already done the 
[Express version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) so this is a nice 
starting point.  It runs through creating a skeleton site, using models, admin site, creating pages with list and 
detail views, anonymous and aithenticated sessions, forms, testing and deployment.
